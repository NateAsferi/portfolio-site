<h2>⭐My Portfolio Website⭐</h2>

This repository holds the files to my portfolio website, which is deployed by GitHub Pages. 

The website lists projects I’m currently working on as well as my technical skills and contact information.

Currently only has one static webpage built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Hoping to add more webpages with information on projects.

Built with the intention of having a mobile friendly design.
